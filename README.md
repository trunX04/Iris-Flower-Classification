## Overview ##
The Iris Flower Classifier is a machine learning project that predicts the class of an Iris flower based on its petal and sepal measurements. I have trained the model using Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm on the famous Iris dataset. This project is a simple example of a supervised classification task in the field of machine learning.
